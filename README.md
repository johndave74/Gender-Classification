# Gender-Classification
This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify gender based on a given dataset. 

### Problem Definition
The primary goal is to classify individuals into male or female categories based on certain features. These features could include physical attributes, behavioral data, or any other relevant information.

### Data Gathering & Exploration
Data Exploration
  -- Load the dataset and explore its structure.
  -- Check for missing values, inconsistencies, and overall data quality.
  -- Perform basic statistical analysis and visualize the data distribution for different features.

### Data Preprocessing
  -- Handling Missing Values:
  -- Feature Engineering:
  -- Data Normalization:

### Split the Data
Split the dataset into training and testing sets. A typical split ratio is 80% for training and 20% for testing.

### Model Build
  -- Logistic Regression
  -- Random Forest Regression
  
### Model Training and Evaluation

### Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
